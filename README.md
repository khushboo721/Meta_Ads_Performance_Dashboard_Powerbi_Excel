# Meta_Ads_Performance_Dashboard_Powerbi_Excel 

## 1. Project Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive performance-monitoring dashboard analysing advertising campaigns across Facebook & Instagram (Meta platforms). Developed using Microsoft Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visualisation, the dashboard enables marketing teams to track key metrics — impressions, clicks, engagements, conversions and budget allocation — and make data-driven decisions to optimise campaign ROI.
